MY NOTES for learning OpenGL
----------------------------

Terminology:

1. Extension - something provided by graphics device driver manufacturer
to do fancy advances graphics stuff.
2. Context   - the state machine of OpenGL. Context can be changed using
state-changing/state-using functions.
3. Object    - an abstraction which has a set of options to describe a 
subset of OpenGL state
4. GLFW      - library written in C specific for OpenGL for displaying things 
			   to render on
5. GLAD		 - openGL is a specification but we require definitions. Open-source
			   web service for setting definitions of openGL functions
