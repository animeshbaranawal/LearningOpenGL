Graphics Pipeline
-----------------

1. Vertex Shader - transform 3D coordinates into different 3D coordinates	
				   (based on camera!?)
2. Primitive assembly - forming primitive shapes from vertex data of vertex shader
				   (like using GL_LINES, GL_TRIANGLES etc.)
3. Geometry shader - forming new shapes out of primitive shapes	
					 (what is the purpose!?)
4. Rasterization - Converting 3D coordinates to 2D screen positions and finally
				   resulting in what pixels on the screen to use.
5. Fragment Shader - Assigning colors to the pixels selected by rasterization
6. Alpha Tests and Blending - Correcting the output for depth perception and applying
							  opacity values to the colors.
							  
Buffers and Bindings
--------------------

1. First, we create a buffer with a given unique id using gl_genBuffers
2. Second, we bind the created to a buffer to a particular type using gl_BindBuffers
3. Third, we fill the buffer by copying the user data using glBufferData

NOTE: GL_STATIC_DRAW vs GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW vs GL_STREAM_DRAW
